Running multiple goals at once

    In the following example, the plugin will create a java class, an *.hbm.xml
    mapping file, and a hibernate.cfg.xml file from a database automatically.

    So we will have to run three goals at once, "hbm2hbmxml", "hbm2cfgxml",
    and "hbm2java" goals.

    The goal that is being used to do this is the "run" goal, that it takes
    the multiple goals found in <<<configuration>>> and executes them.
